# My_ESP_journey
Here you can find my journey into Embedded Systems:
if you are an beginner or like first year of your graduation let me explain you I wish to start if I'm in your place right now.
Start early as ealry
C programmming is must be mastered
start with data types,conditional statements,loops,functions,pointers,arrays, structures,
in parallel cover Electronics Fundamentals
like number systems,analog electronics , digital electronics, micro processor memory map, microcontroller
once you have done upto basics of structures start embedded programming from LEDs , Seven Segment display, switch, keypad,dotmatrix
I done all this under the guidence of Mr.Balajee Sheshadri ( linkedin.com/in/balajeeseshadri )
